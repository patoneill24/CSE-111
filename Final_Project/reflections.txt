Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

I think I saw the power of functions while completing my final project. I was able to make a
function that took a dictionary and returned a new dictionary with the keys that contain the top 5 values. I 
was able to run several different dictionaries as arguments for that function, and I was able to get results very quickly
that helped me retrieve the data I needed for my charts. 


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
    
Test functions hold great value becase they ensure that the functions you wrote work as you intended. You may have written a 
great function that works, but it didn't get the results that you were meaning to get when you originally coded it. 


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

The first thing I do when fixing a program is I check to make sure I have proper syntax and then I make corrections as needed.
If my code still doesn't work as intened, I google the error I got in my code to better understand what it means and how I can fix it.
If I still am having troubles, I'll ask a classmate or a professor to look over my code. I could improve this process by utilizing the debugger
function more often.
